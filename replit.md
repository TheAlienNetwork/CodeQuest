# CodeQuest - Interactive Coding Education Platform

## Overview

CodeQuest is a gamified coding education platform that combines interactive coding challenges with AI-powered assistance. The application features a quest-based learning system where users progress through coding challenges, earn XP, and level up their programming skills. The platform includes real-time code execution, AI chat support, and a comprehensive user progression system.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
User requested: Remove OpenAI dependency, create custom AI logic, add learning panel, add many more quests/levels, add "Next Quest" button for completed quests, start at absolute beginner level progressing to advanced applications/games, make RPG-style fun lessons to keep users engaged.
